# Unit-Conversion
Unit Conversion Tool is a beginner-friendly web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as part of a self-paced learning journey to apply and strengthen my front-end development skills. The tool allows users to convert between various units such as temperature (Celsius to Fahrenheit), weight (Kilograms to Pounds), and distance (Kilometers to Miles). The layout is designed with clear sections, intuitive inputs, and a responsive user interface. Each conversion module also provides the underlying formula, making the tool educational as well as functional. Though simple in structure, this project reflects my foundational understanding of web development and marks the beginning of many more creative builds ahead.
